- 👋 Hi, I’m @morganmacarthur
- 👀 I’m interested in Go (lang), AMP (HTML) and other languages and frameworks that use common words for names and require extra information to be identified properly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go multithreaded network programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CSS AMP, a classless HTML framework for AMP based on BareCSS by Long Sien.
