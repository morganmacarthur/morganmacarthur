- 👋 Hi, I’m @morganmacarthur
- 👀 I’m interested in Go (lang), AMP (HTML) and other languages and frameworks that use common words for their names making searching for them more difficult.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go multithreaded network programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CSS AMP, a classless HTML framework for AMP based on BareCSS by Long Sien.
- 📫 How to reach me: morganm@gmail.com
